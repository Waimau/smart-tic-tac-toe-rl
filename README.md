The project mainly consists of two aspects:

1. The use of rewards and value functions.
2. The initialization, updating, and exploitation of the value function within the game of Tic Tac Toe.

The detailed explanation of these topics and the logic behind the decision making process of the AI agents are all elaborated within the [Initial project README](https://waimau.github.io/smart-tic-tac-toe-rl). You are more likely to contribute to the project after gathering knowledge about these topics.

To contribute, follow the standard procedure of forking the repository, making your changes and then creating a Pull Request. Any changes that add value to the project are welcomed!

Enjoy the game and happy coding!
